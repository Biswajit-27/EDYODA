            <h3>ICE-CREAM</h3>
            <p>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is 
                flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such
                 as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food 
                 coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and
                  stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, 
                  semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its 
                  temperature increases.</p>
